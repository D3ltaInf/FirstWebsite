    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yields: 4 servings</p>
    <p>Prep time: 15 minutes</p>
    <p>Cook time: 15-20 minutes</p>
    <p>An adaptable Stir-fry that is perfect for using any leftover vegetables that you have in the fridge.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (low sodium preferred)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil (or vegatable oil)</li>
        <li>1 head broccoli, cut into small florets</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced or julienned</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, cored and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Stir-fry sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate Chicken: In a medium bowl, toss the chicken pieces with 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Let sit for at least 10 minutes while you prep the vegetables (or up to 30 minutes in the fridge). The cornstarch helps tenderize the chicken and gives it a nice coating.</li>
        <li>Prepare Stir-Fry Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together all the stir-fry sauce ingredients until well combined and the cornstarch is dissolved. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook Chicken: Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil (or vegetable oil) in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken in a single layer (you may need to do this in two batches to avoid overcrowding, which steams the chicken instead of browning it). Cook for 3-5 minutes, flipping occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Saut√© Vegetables: Add a little more oil to the skillet if needed. Add the broccoli florets, carrots, and onion. Stir-fry for 3-5 minutes, until they start to soften but are still crisp-tender.</li>
        <li>Add Aromatics & Bell Pepper: Add the minced garlic and grated ginger (if using) to the skillet. Stir-fry for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the sliced red bell pepper and stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine & Sauce: Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the vegetables. Give your stir-fry sauce a quick re-whisk (cornstarch settles) and pour it over the chicken and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Thicken Sauce: Cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes, until the sauce thickens and coats everything nicely.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve immediately over steamed rice or noodles.</li>
    </ol>
