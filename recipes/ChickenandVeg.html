    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yields: 4 servings</p>
    <p>Prep time: 15 minutes</p>
    <p>Cook time: 40-50 minutes</p>
    <p>This recipe is fantastic for a weeknight meal because everything cooks together on a single sheet pan. The chicken stays juicy, and the vegetables get wonderfully tender and caramelized.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 - 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1.5-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 lb small potatoes</li>
        <li>1 lb broccoli florets, cut into bite size pieces</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 red onion, cut into 1-inch wedges</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large lemon, half thinly sliced (for placing on chicken), half juiced (for dressing)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat and Prep: Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easier cleanup, if desired.</li>
        <li>Combine Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the quartered potatoes, broccoli florets, carrot chunks, and red onion wedges.</li>
        <li>Season Everything: Drizzle the vegetables with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and season generously with salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Season Chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the same bowl (or a separate one if you prefer). Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the minced garlic, dried Italian seasoning, paprika (if using), and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Squeeze the juice from half of the lemon over the chicken and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Arrange on Pan: Spread the seasoned vegetables in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Place the seasoned chicken pieces among the vegetables, ensuring they are in a single layer. Arrange the thin lemon slices over the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Roast: Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature of 165째F / 74째C) and the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized. If you're using bone-in chicken, it might take a bit longer. For extra crispiness, you can broil for the last 2-3 minutes, but watch it carefully to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove from the oven. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley if you like. Serve hot directly from the pan!</li>
    </ol>
