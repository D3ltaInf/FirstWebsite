        <li>Oil or cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven & Brown Meat: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease your 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium-high heat, breaking it up with a spoon. Drain any excess grease. Stir in the spaghetti/marinara sauce and Italian seasoning (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let it simmer gently for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare Cheese Mixture: In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Assemble Lasagna:
            <ul>
                <li>Spread about 1 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of your prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Arrange 3-4 no-boil lasagna noodles over the sauce (you might need to break them to fit).</li>
                <li>Spread about half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Top with another layer of meat sauce (about 1.5 cups).</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Place a final layer of noodles on top, then cover with the remaining meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle generously with the remaining mozzarella cheese and a little extra Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bake:
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and lightly golden.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Rest & serve: Let the lasagna rest for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps it set and prevents it from falling apart.</li>
    </ol>
